## 🏆 v1.1 Verified Architecture - What You Released

### Major Achievement

After **comprehensive audit and synchronization**, we have restored the true "Builder Prompt Architecture" that was missing from the initial v1.0 release. This includes the advanced context handling and "Actionable Insight" templates.

- **3x larger prompts**: 30KB vs 10KB baseline
- **16KB+ builder content**: Quality rules, patterns, UI components automatically injected
- **6 builder prompts**: Evidence Binding, Next Best Action, Risk Assessment, Alert Boxes, Stat Cards, Healthcare Context

### Core Features (Restored & Verified)

1.  **AI-Powered Insights (Stage 7)**
    *   **New**: Templates now strictly enforce "Actionable Insights" vs simple data display.
    *   **New**: Executive Summary placeholders.
    *   **New**: Business Value connection instructions.

2.  **Context Intelligence (Stages 2-6)**
    *   **New**: `companyProfile` and `industryContext` flowed from Stage 2 through to Prompt Assembly.
    *   **New**: Field selection now intelligently filters inaccessible fields (`!field.isAccessible`) to prevent runtime crashes.

3.  **Builder Prompt System (Stage 8)**
    *   **Restored**: Dynamic injection of Quality Rules, Patterns, and UI Components from `ccai__AI_Prompt__c`.

## 🚀 You're Now On: feature/data-availability-context

**Current Branch**: `feature/data-availability-context`  
**Purpose**: Make AI follow builder rules consistently  
**Timeline**: 2-3 hours  

### The Goal

Fix the issue where AI says:
- ❌ "the CFO" instead of "Sarah Johnson (CFO)"
- ❌ "follow up soon" instead of "by January 27"
- ❌ "close date in past" instead of "22 days overdue (12/31/2025)"

### The Plan

See `NEXT_PHASE_DATA_AVAILABILITY.md` for full implementation guide.
