=== EVIDENCE BINDING RULE (MANDATORY) ===

=== ANALYTICAL PATTERNS: ACCOUNT 360 OPTIMIZED STACK ===

Apply these patterns for comprehensive account view:

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (2-3 sentences synthesizing account health)
2. METRICS CALCULATION (Key account metrics, opportunity pipeline, case health)
3. RISK ASSESSMENT (Account-level risks from opportunities and cases)
4. SENTIMENT ANALYSIS (Case sentiment distribution)
5. NEXT BEST ACTION (Top 3 account-level priorities)

=== UI/UX: ACCOUNT 360 ENHANCED DESIGN ===

CREATE VISUALLY STUNNING ACCOUNT 360 with diverse components:

SECTION 1 - HERO METRICS (Big stat cards grid):
- Total Pipeline Value
- Open Opportunities Count
- Open Cases Count
- Account Health Score (calculated based on risks/sentiment)
- Days Since Last Activity
- Primary Contact Name

Use BIG NUMBERS (42px) with semantic colors.

SECTION 2 - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (Alert box with key takeaway):
Use info alert box (blue background) with 2-3 sentence summary.

SECTION 3 - ACCOUNT HEALTH SIGNALS (Visual indicators):
Create visual "signal cards" showing:
- Engagement Health (progress bar)
- Sentiment Health (Pos/Neu/Neg distribution with colors)
- Pipeline Health (opportunity stage distribution)
- Response Time (case handling speed)

SECTION 4 - TOP RISKS (Visual risk cards):
Show 2-3 most critical account risks using red/orange alert boxes.
NOT a table - individual alert cards with evidence, impact, action.

SECTION 5 - OPPORTUNITIES ANALYSIS (Enhanced):
NOT just a table. Create:
- Summary stats at top (total value, average size, stage breakdown)
- Then opportunity cards OR enhanced table with visual indicators (not plain text)
- Each opportunity should show risk level, next action, days to close

SECTION 6 - CASE ANALYSIS (Enhanced):
NOT just a table. Create:
- Sentiment distribution visual
- Case priority breakdown
- Then case cards OR enhanced table with sentiment badges and urgency indicators

SECTION 7 - PRIORITY ACTIONS (Action cards):
3-5 visual action cards with priority colors, evidence, timeline.

=== HEALTHCARE PAYER CONTEXT ===
COMPANY: UnitedHealthcare
PRIORITIES: CFO (TCO, ROI), CIO (Security, Integration)
TERMINOLOGY: "Member" not "Customer", "Plan" not "Product"

=== EXCELLENCE CRITERIA ===

1. VISUAL DIVERSITY: Use 6+ different component types
2. NO PLAIN TABLES: Enhance tables with visual indicators or replace with cards
3. COLOR USAGE: Strategic use of semantic colors (not everything gray)
4. TYPOGRAPHY: Clear hierarchy (42px → 20px → 16px → 14px → 12px)
5. ANALYTICAL DEPTH: Every section should provide insights, not just data display
6. EVIDENCE: Every insight must cite specific fields
