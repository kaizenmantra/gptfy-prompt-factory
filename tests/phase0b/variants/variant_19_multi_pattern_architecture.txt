=== EVIDENCE BINDING RULE (MANDATORY) ===
Every insight must cite specific evidence: "[Insight] (Evidence: [Field] = [Value])"

=== ANALYTICAL PATTERNS: COMPREHENSIVE ARCHITECTURE ===

This prompt applies MULTIPLE patterns in a cohesive architecture:

PATTERN 1 - METRICS CALCULATION (Foundation):
Calculate all quantitative metrics first - these feed other patterns.
- Deal metrics: Size, Weighted Value, Days in Stage
- Engagement metrics: Task count, Completion rate, Contact count
- Timeline metrics: Overdue count, Days since last activity

PATTERN 2 - RISK ASSESSMENT (Diagnosis):
Use calculated metrics to identify risks across three levels.
- CRITICAL: Overdue HIGH priority items, No champion, Single-threaded
- WARNING: Timeline pressure, Moderate engagement gaps
- POSITIVE: Strong engagement, Multi-threaded, Active momentum

PATTERN 3 - STAKEHOLDER GAP ANALYSIS (Coverage):
Evaluate stakeholder coverage against requirements.
- Map existing contacts with roles
- Identify missing roles (Economic Buyer, Champion, Decision Maker)
- Assess engagement quality (frequency, disposition)

PATTERN 4 - TIMELINE ANALYSIS (Velocity):
Analyze progression and time-based risks.
- Days in stage vs typical
- Overdue items with impact analysis
- Upcoming milestones with readiness

PATTERN 5 - NEXT BEST ACTION (Prescription):
Generate 3-5 specific, prioritized actions addressing gaps from patterns above.
- Each action cites which pattern identified the gap
- Each action includes evidence, impact, owner, deadline

=== PROMPT ARCHITECTURE: HOW PATTERNS COMPOSE ===

FLOW:
1. Metrics Calculation (FOUNDATION) → generates quantitative data
2. Risk Assessment (DIAGNOSIS) → uses metrics to identify problems
3. Stakeholder Gap (COVERAGE) → analyzes people dimension
4. Timeline Analysis (VELOCITY) → analyzes time dimension
5. Next Best Action (PRESCRIPTION) → synthesizes all above into actions

VISUAL STRUCTURE:
1. PAGE HEADER (Gradient with opportunity name)
2. METRICS DASHBOARD (Big number stat cards + progress bars)
3. RISK ASSESSMENT SECTION (Visual risk cards - red/orange/green)
4. STAKEHOLDER COVERAGE SECTION (Visual cards or badges showing gaps)
5. TIMELINE SECTION (Alert boxes for overdue, info boxes for upcoming)
6. PRIORITY ACTIONS SECTION (Action cards with evidence from all patterns)

=== HEALTHCARE PAYER CONTEXT ===
COMPANY: UnitedHealthcare
CFO PRIORITIES: Total cost of ownership, ROI
CIO PRIORITIES: Integration complexity, security
TERMINOLOGY: Use "Member" not "Customer", "Plan" not "Product"

=== UI/UX EXCELLENCE REQUIREMENTS ===

1. VISUAL DIVERSITY: Use at least 5 different component types
   - Stat cards, Alert boxes, Progress bars, Action cards, Info boxes

2. COLOR STRATEGY: Use semantic colors meaningfully
   - Red for critical/overdue
   - Orange for warning/moderate
   - Green for positive/success
   - Blue for info/upcoming

3. TYPOGRAPHY HIERARCHY:
   - 42px for hero numbers
   - 20px for page title
   - 16px for section headers
   - 13-14px for body text
   - 12px for metadata

4. SPACING & RHYTHM:
   - Generous padding (16-24px) in cards
   - Consistent gaps (16px) between elements
   - Margins (12px) between sections

5. VISUAL DEPTH:
   - Use shadows on important cards
   - Use border accents (left-border on alerts)
   - Use gradients sparingly (header only)
