# Evidence Binding Rules (v2)

**Version**: 2.0  
**Purpose**: Define how to cite data sources without overwhelming the user  
**Key Change**: Insight-first approach replaces evidence-first  

---

## Core Principle

> **Every claim must be traceable. No claim should lead with its source.**
>
> Evidence binding ensures analytical integrity. But users care about 
> the INSIGHT, not the audit trail. Make evidence available, not prominent.

## The Insight-First Pattern

### Format Hierarchy

Use the highest-appropriate level. Reserve explicit citations for detailed sections.

---

### Level 1: Embedded Data (Use 80% of the Time)

Data point woven naturally into the insight. No explicit citation.

**Pattern:**
```
[Insight with data point naturally embedded]
```

**Examples:**
```
✅ "This $1.5M deal needs executive sponsor engagement before close."
✅ "With only 67 days to close and no discovery meeting scheduled..."
✅ "The 4 engaged stakeholders don't include anyone with budget authority."
✅ "Stage has been stalled for 45 days—well beyond your 21-day benchmark."
```

**When to use:**
- Executive summary (Zone 3)
- Key insights in stat cards (Zone 2)
- Action card descriptions (Zone 4)
- Any above-the-fold content

**What makes it work:**
- The number IS the insight ("$1.5M", "67 days", "4 stakeholders")
- No need to say where it came from
- User trusts you got it from Salesforce
- Source available in Zone 6 if they want to verify

---

### Level 2: Parenthetical Source (Use 15% of the Time)

Insight first, with brief source reference in parentheses.

**Pattern:**
```
[Insight statement]. (Source: FieldName)
```

**Examples:**
```
✅ "No executive sponsor identified. (Source: Contact Roles)"
✅ "Budget not yet confirmed. (Source: Opportunity custom field)"
✅ "Deal velocity below average. (Benchmark: 90-day Enterprise cycle)"
```

**When to use:**
- When the data source adds credibility to a surprising claim
- When there might be ambiguity about where info came from
- When referencing a custom field or non-obvious source
- Risk assessment details (Zone 5)

**What makes it work:**
- Insight still leads
- Source is secondary, not prominent
- Parenthetical is naturally de-emphasized
- User can ignore if not interested

---

### Level 3: Inline Citation (Use 5% of the Time)

Explicit "based on" statement after insight, for detailed analysis only.

**Pattern:**
```
[Insight statement]
→ Based on: FieldName = Value
```

**Examples:**
```
✅ "Deal timeline is at significant risk."
   → Based on: Stage Age = 45 days (benchmark: 21 days), Close Date = March 28

✅ "Champion engagement has dropped off."
   → Based on: Last Contact = 23 days ago, Previous average = 7 days
```

**When to use:**
- Detailed analysis sections (Zone 5) only
- When showing a calculation or comparison
- When the specific value matters for understanding
- When contrasting actual vs. expected

**What makes it work:**
- Appears in "drill-down" sections, not primary view
- User has already opted-in to detail by scrolling
- Shows the work without cluttering the main message

---

### Level 4: Collapsible Data Sources (For Audit Trail)

Full field citations available on demand, collapsed by default.

**Pattern:**
```html
<details>
  <summary>📊 Data Sources</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Deal Size: Opportunity.Amount = $1,500,000</li>
    <li>Close Date: Opportunity.CloseDate = 2026-03-28</li>
    ...
  </ul>
</details>
```

**When to use:**
- End of every generated report (Zone 6)
- Always collapsed by default
- User expands only if they want to verify

**What makes it work:**
- Evidence is available for audit/compliance
- But it's not competing for attention
- Keeps the main output scannable
- Satisfies "show your work" requirement without clutter

---

## What NOT to Do

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 1: Evidence-First

```
WRONG:
"Evidence: Opportunity.Amount = $1,500,000
 Evidence: Opportunity.StageName = Needs Analysis
 Evidence: Opportunity.Probability = 20%
 
 Based on this data, the deal size is significant and may require 
 executive involvement."
```

**Problems:**
- User has to wade through data to find the insight
- Field API names are technical jargon
- "Based on this data" buries the lead
- Feels like reading a database query result

**Fix:**
```
CORRECT:
"This $1.5M deal requires executive sponsor engagement—it's still 
in early qualification with only 20% probability."
```

---

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 2: Over-Citation

```
WRONG:
"The opportunity name is 'McDonald's Q1 Expansion' (Evidence: 
Opportunity.Name). The account is McDonald's Corporation (Evidence: 
Account.Name). The amount is $1,500,000 (Evidence: Opportunity.Amount). 
The close date is March 28, 2026 (Evidence: Opportunity.CloseDate)."
```

**Problems:**
- Unreadable
- Treats user like an auditor, not a decision-maker
- Every sentence interrupted by citation
- Zero synthesis

**Fix:**
```
CORRECT:
"$1.5M McDonald's deal targeting Q1 close. Currently in early stage 
with 67 days remaining."
```

---

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 3: Citation Without Insight

```
WRONG:
"Evidence: Task.Subject = 'Send ROI Analysis'
 Evidence: Task.Status = 'Open'
 Evidence: Task.ActivityDate = '2026-01-15'"
```

**Problems:**
- So what? What does this mean?
- User has to figure out why this matters
- No actionable conclusion

**Fix:**
```
CORRECT:
"ROI Analysis is overdue (was due Jan 15)—this is blocking CFO 
budget approval."
```

---

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 4: Generic Claims Without Data

```
WRONG:
"This deal is at risk and needs immediate attention."
```

**Problems:**
- Vague
- No specifics user can act on
- Why is it at risk? What kind of attention?

**Fix:**
```
CORRECT:
"This deal is at risk: 67 days to close but still in early stage, 
with no executive sponsor and an overdue ROI analysis."
```

## Transformation Examples

### Opportunity Analysis

| Evidence-First (Avoid) | Insight-First (Use) |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| "Amount = $1.5M. This is a large deal." | "Large deal ($1.5M) requires executive sponsor." |
| "Probability = 20%." | "Low win confidence (20%)—qualification gaps remain." |
| "CloseDate = 2026-03-28. There are 67 days remaining." | "Only 67 days to close from early stage." |
| "StageName = Needs Analysis for 45 days." | "Stalled 45 days in qualification—exceeds 21-day benchmark." |
| "Contact count = 4." | "4 stakeholders engaged but no CFO access." |

### Risk Assessment

| Evidence-First (Avoid) | Insight-First (Use) |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| "Evidence: No Contact with Role = 'Economic Buyer'" | "No economic buyer identified—budget approval at risk." |
| "Evidence: Task overdue by 7 days" | "ROI Analysis overdue 7 days—blocking CFO meeting." |
| "Evidence: LastActivityDate > 14 days" | "No activity in 14 days—engagement may be stalling." |
| "Evidence: Competitor field is not empty" | "Active competitive threat: [Competitor] also engaged." |

### Timeline Analysis

| Evidence-First (Avoid) | Insight-First (Use) |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| "Stage Age = 45 days. Benchmark = 21 days." | "2x longer than typical at this stage—velocity concern." |
| "Close Date moved 3 times." | "Close date extended 3 times—credibility at risk." |
| "Created Date = 2025-10-15, Today = 2026-01-22." | "99-day-old opportunity still in early qualification." |

## Context-Specific Guidelines

### Above-the-Fold Content (Zones 1-4)

**Rule:** Use Level 1 (embedded) or Level 2 (parenthetical) only.

```
✅ ALLOWED:
"$1.5M deal at risk: 67 days to close but early stage."
"No executive sponsor identified. (Source: Contact Roles)"

❌ NOT ALLOWED:
"Evidence: Amount = $1,500,000..."
"Based on: Opportunity.StageName = 'Needs Analysis'..."
```

### Detailed Analysis (Zone 5)

**Rule:** Level 1, 2, or 3 are all appropriate.

```
✅ ALLOWED:
"Deal velocity has slowed significantly."
→ Based on: Stage Age = 45 days (benchmark: 21 days)
```

### Data Sources Section (Zone 6)

**Rule:** Level 4—complete field listing, always collapsed.

```
✅ REQUIRED:
<details>
  <summary>Data Sources</summary>
  Complete field list with values
</details>
```

## Implementation for Prompts

### Injection Text for Stage08

Add this to the prompt assembly:

```
=== EVIDENCE BINDING RULES ===

Every analytical claim must be traceable to Salesforce data, but 
INSIGHT LEADS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTS.

FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
1. ABOVE THE FOLD: Embed data naturally into insights
   - Good: "This $1.5M deal needs CFO engagement"
   - Bad: "Evidence: Amount = $1,500,000. This is significant."

2. DETAILED ANALYSIS: Use inline citations sparingly
   - Good: "Stage stalled 45 days (benchmark: 21 days)"
   - Bad: "Evidence: Stage Age = 45. Evidence: Benchmark = 21."

3. END OF REPORT: Include collapsible data sources section
   - List all fields used
   - Collapsed by default
   - For verification, not primary reading

NEVER:
- Start any sentence with "Evidence:"
- List field values without an insight
- Interrupt flow with multiple citations
- Use API field names in visible text (translate to plain language)

ALWAYS:
- Lead with the "so what"
- Weave numbers into natural sentences
- Provide specific recommendations
- Make data sources available but not prominent
```

### Quality Check Prompt for Stage12

Add this dimension:

```
EVIDENCE APPROPRIATENESS (15%):
Does the output properly balance insight and evidence?

Score 1-3: Evidence-first approach, technical jargon, over-citation
Score 4-6: Mixed approach, some buried insights, inconsistent
Score 7-10: Insight-first, natural data embedding, clean citations
```
